# LLM Architect Command

Design LLM system architecture using the llm-architect subagent.

## LLM System Design Task

$ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. Analyze LLM system requirements:
   - Use cases and requirements
   - Performance targets (latency, throughput)
   - Scale expectations
   - Budget constraints
   - Safety and compliance needs
   - Integration points

2. Delegate to the `llm-architect` subagent to:
   - Design optimal LLM architecture
   - Plan fine-tuning strategies if needed
   - Implement RAG system if required
   - Optimize prompting and context management
   - Configure safety filters and monitoring
   - Plan cost optimization
   - Setup production deployment
   - Implement evaluation metrics

3. The llm-architect will work on:
   - Model selection and configuration
   - Serving infrastructure design
   - Caching and optimization strategies
   - RAG implementation
   - Prompt engineering
   - Safety mechanisms
   - Cost optimization
   - Monitoring and evaluation

4. Provide LLM architecture including:
   - System design overview
   - Model selection rationale
   - Infrastructure configuration
   - Performance specifications
   - Cost analysis
   - Safety measures
   - Monitoring setup
   - Scaling strategy

## Output Format

Output LLM architecture design in Japanese, following the llm-architect subagent's response format.
